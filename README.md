# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
  Using accquired basic skill that we just develop in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning, we will try to analyze a credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. In this real-world situation, we determine the unbalance classification problem between good loans and risky loans that sourrounds the aspect of credit risk. Different number of statical mathematical algorithms to evaluate the dataset in a supervised learning categorory to make vaild predictions. A comparison will made between each of the algorithm that are employed in the analysis.
